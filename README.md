ioBroker.ical is an adapter for the ioBroker automation platform focusing on iCalendar files, widely used for storing and sharing calendar data. It allows users to read and parse iCalendar files locally or from a specified URL.  

With ioBroker.ical, you can perform various actions based on calendar events, such as triggering smart home devices, sending notifications, or executing specific scripts or routines. For example, you could create automation rules that turn on the lights when a particular event is about to start or send a reminder notification for an upcoming appointment.  

Sentry reporting, starting with js-controller 3.0, means that this adapter can use Sentry libraries to report exceptions and code errors to developers automatically. For more details and how to disable error reporting, see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry).
